# AIXchange Architecture

## System Overview
AIXchange is a platform for sharing and discovering AI solutions, with integrated event and community features. The system is built using Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## Core Components

### 1. Solution Management
- Solution submission and review
- Solution marketplace
- Solution categorization and tagging
- Solution voting and feedback

### 2. Event System
The event system enables community engagement through organized challenges and competitions:

#### Event Management
- Event creation and lifecycle management
- Event participation tracking
- Event-specific solution submissions
- Event leaderboards and statistics

#### Event Discovery and Filtering
- Client-side filtering with server-side data fetching
- URL-based search parameters for shareable filters
- Debounced search input for performance
- Real-time filter updates using Next.js App Router
- Filter categories:
  - Search text (title and description)
  - Event status (UPCOMING, ACTIVE, VOTING, COMPLETED)
  - Event type (HACKATHON, CHALLENGE, COMPETITION, WORKSHOP)

#### Event Types
- Hackathons
- Challenges
- Competitions
- Workshops

#### Event-Solution Integration
- Solutions can be submitted independently or as part of events
- Event solutions can be promoted to the global marketplace
- Maintains separation between event and general solutions
- Solution submission validation based on event status
- Automatic status transitions based on event dates

### 3. User Management
- Authentication (NextAuth.js)
- Role-based authorization
- User profiles and activity tracking
- User participation in events

### 4. Admin Features
- Solution moderation
- Event management
- User management
- System statistics and monitoring

## Data Model

### Core Entities
```prisma
model Solution {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  title         String
  description   String
  // ... other fields
  eventId       String?  // Optional link to event
  event         Event?   @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id])
}

model Event {
  id              String    @id @default(cuid())
  title           String
  description     String
  shortDescription String
  startDate       DateTime
  endDate         DateTime
  status          EventStatus
  type            EventType
  // ... other fields
  solutions       Solution[]
  participants    EventParticipant[]
}

model EventParticipant {
  id              String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId          String
  eventId         String
  role            ParticipantRole
  // ... other fields
}
```

## API Architecture

### RESTful Endpoints

#### Solution APIs
- `/api/solutions` - Solution CRUD operations
- `/api/solutions/vote` - Solution voting
- `/api/solutions/import` - Bulk solution import

#### Event APIs
- `/api/events` - Event CRUD operations and filtered listing
  - Query parameters:
    - search: Search in title and description
    - status: Filter by event status
    - type: Filter by event type
- `/api/events/[id]/join` - Event participation
- `/api/events/[id]/solutions` - Event-specific solutions

#### Admin APIs
- `/api/admin/solutions` - Solution moderation
- `/api/admin/events` - Event management
- `/api/admin/users` - User management

### API Design Principles
1. RESTful resource naming
2. Consistent error handling
3. Input validation using Zod
4. Authentication and authorization middleware
5. Rate limiting and security measures

## Frontend Architecture

### Page Structure
```
/app
  /src
    /app
      /events              # Event pages
      /solutions           # Solution pages
      /admin              # Admin pages
      /api               # API routes
    /components
      /events           # Event components
        /EventsGrid     # Event listing with filters
        /EventsFilters  # Search and filter controls
        /EventCard      # Event display component
      /solutions        # Solution components
      /admin           # Admin components
      /ui              # Shared UI components
```

### Component Organization
1. Page Components
   - Handle data fetching
   - Manage page-level state
   - Compose feature components

2. Feature Components
   - Implement specific functionality
   - Handle user interactions
   - Manage component-level state

3. UI Components
   - Reusable design system components
   - Consistent styling and behavior
   - Accessibility compliance

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Multiple auth providers (Email, Google, GitHub)
- Session management and security

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Resource-level permissions
- Event-specific access control

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Performance Optimization

### Database
- Efficient indexing
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling

### Frontend
