# Image Guidelines for Solution Cards

## Technical Specifications
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (landscape)
- Recommended Resolution: 1200x675 pixels (2x for retina displays)
- Minimum Resolution: 600x338 pixels
- Format: PNG or JPEG
- Maximum File Size: 2MB

## DALL-E Prompt Template
When generating images with DALL-E or similar AI tools, use this template:

```
Create a 16:9 landscape image of [your subject], centered in the frame, with [subject details]. 
Include ample padding around the main subject. 
Use [style/mood] visual style.
Ensure the focal point is in the center of the composition.
```

### Example Prompts:

1. For Technology Solutions:
```
Create a 16:9 landscape image of a modern technological interface, centered in the frame, with holographic displays and subtle blue glowing elements. Include ample padding around the main interface. Use a clean, minimalist visual style with a dark background. Ensure the focal point is in the center of the composition.
```

2. For AI Solutions:
```
Create a 16:9 landscape image of an abstract AI neural network visualization, centered in the frame, with interconnected nodes and flowing data streams. Include ample padding around the main visualization. Use a futuristic, high-tech visual style with a gradient background. Ensure the focal point is in the center of the composition.
```

## Best Practices

1. Composition
- Center the main subject/focal point
- Leave sufficient padding around edges
- Avoid crucial elements near the edges
- Use symmetrical compositions when possible

2. Content
- Keep the subject matter clear and focused
- Avoid busy or cluttered backgrounds
- Use consistent color schemes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

3. Visual Style
- Maintain professional and modern aesthetics
- Use appropriate tech-focused imagery
- Keep text minimal or avoid it entirely
- Consider dark mode compatibility

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Composition Issues
- ❌ Subject too close to edges
- ❌ Important elements outside center area
- ❌ Asymmetrical or unbalanced layouts

2. Technical Issues
- ❌ Wrong aspect ratio
- ❌ Low resolution
- ❌ Poor image quality
- ❌ Excessive file size

3. Content Issues
- ❌ Overcrowded compositions
- ❌ Distracting backgrounds
- ❌ Poor contrast
- ❌ Text-heavy images

## Tips for AI Image Generation

1. Specify Composition
- Always mention "centered in the frame"
- Request "ample padding" or "negative space"
- Specify "landscape orientation"
- Include "16:9 aspect ratio" in prompts

2. Style Guidance
- Use clear style descriptors (e.g., "minimalist", "futuristic", "professional")
- Specify color schemes when relevant
- Request specific lighting effects if needed
- Mention desired mood or atmosphere

3. Quality Control
- Generate multiple variations
- Check resolution and aspect ratio
- Verify center composition
- Ensure subject clarity

## Examples of Good vs Bad Images

Good Image Characteristics:
- ✅ Centered main subject
- ✅ Proper 16:9 ratio
- ✅ Clear focal point
- ✅ Sufficient padding
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Consistent style

Bad Image Characteristics:
- ❌ Off-center composition
- ❌ Incorrect aspect ratio
- ❌ Cluttered layout
- ❌ Edge-to-edge content
- ❌ Inconsistent style
- ❌ Poor quality or resolution
