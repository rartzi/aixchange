- Added author/submitter filtering capability
- Enhanced price range filtering with min/max inputs
- Added price-based sorting options
- Improved UI layout for filters
- Added proper TypeScript types using solution schema
- Implemented "Load More" pagination
- Enhanced error states and loading indicators

#### Backend (API Route)
- Added support for author/submitter filtering with case-insensitive search
- Implemented price range filtering in database queries
- Added price-based sorting options

- Added proper pagination metadata

### Technical Details
- Updated SolutionsGrid component to use proper TypeScript types from solution schema
- Enhanced API route with new filter parameters and sorting options
