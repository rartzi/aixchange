# Session: Docker Deployment Enhancement

## Overview
Improving Docker deployment configuration for production readiness.

## Goals
1. Optimize Docker configuration for production
2. Set up multi-stage builds
3. Configure proper caching and volume management
4. Implement health checks
5. Set up Docker Compose for local development
6. Document deployment procedures

## Current State Analysis
- Basic Dockerfile exists
- Docker Compose for development
- Need to optimize for production
- Need to improve caching strategy
- Need to handle persistent data properly

## Technical Details

### Areas to Address
1. Multi-stage builds
   - Separate build and runtime stages
   - Minimize final image size
   - Optimize layer caching

2. Environment Configuration
   - Production vs development settings
   - Secure secrets management
   - Environment variable handling

3. Volume Management
   - Persistent data storage
   - Upload directories
   - Cache directories
   - Node modules

4. Performance Optimization
   - Build caching
   - Layer optimization
   - Dependencies management

5. Security
   - Non-root user
   - Minimal base image
   - Security scanning
   - Secrets handling

6. Monitoring
   - Health checks
   - Logging configuration
   - Metrics collection

## Next Steps
1. Review current Docker configuration
2. Implement multi-stage builds
3. Set up proper volume management
4. Add health checks
5. Update documentation
6. Test deployment process
