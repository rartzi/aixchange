# Development Session Log

## 📆 Session Metadata
- **Project:** AIXchange
- **Sprint/Milestone:** Production Deployment
- **Date:** 2024-02-23
- **Start Time:** 22:15
- **End Time:** Ongoing
- **Participants:** Development Team

## 🎯 Session Goals
1. Enable Production Deployment for Demo [P0]
   - Expected Outcome: Working production build for demo purposes
   - Success Criteria: Application runs in production mode
   - Dependencies: Next.js configuration, Docker resources

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/next.config.ts`: Force dynamic rendering configuration [P0]
  * Purpose: Force all pages to be dynamic for demo deployment
  * Impact: 
    - Disables static page generation completely
    - All pages will be server-side rendered
    - Higher server resource usage but more reliable for demo
  * Dependencies: None
  * Reversion: Remove unstable_runtimeJS and unstable_noStore flags to restore static generation

## 🐛 Issues & Challenges
### High Priority (P1)
- [x] Issue: Static page generation failing for multiple pages
  * Impact: Blocked production deployment
  * Solution: Force dynamic rendering for all pages (Option A)
  * Status: Implementing temporary solution
  * Rationale: Chose simplest solution for demo phase with limited users (20 max)

## 🔄 Next Steps
### High Priority (P1)
1. Post-Demo Optimization
   - Timeline: After successful demo
   - Dependencies: None
   - Success Criteria: 
     * Re-enable static generation where appropriate
     * Implement proper static/dynamic page handling
     * Tasks:
       1. Identify which pages can be static
       2. Implement proper Suspense boundaries
       3. Test static generation page by page
       4. Monitor performance metrics

## 📝 Notes
### Important Technical Debt Decision
We've chosen to temporarily force all pages to be dynamic (Option A) because:

1. Simplest solution for quick demo deployment
2. Limited user base (20 people max)
3. Higher resource availability in demo environment
4. Easy to revert (remove two config flags)

### Reversion Process
To revert this change:
1. Remove unstable_runtimeJS and unstable_noStore from next.config.ts
2. Test static generation capability page by page
3. Implement proper Suspense boundaries where needed

This technical debt is tracked and prioritized for post-demo cleanup to ensure proper production optimization.
