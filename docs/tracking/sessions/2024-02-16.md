## Session 10 (22:48) - Docker & Infrastructure Setup

### Overview
Initial project setup with Docker, Next.js, and Prisma integration. Established core infrastructure and development environment.

### Completed Tasks
1. Docker Configuration
   - Set up PostgreSQL database container
   - Configured Next.js application container
   - Implemented health checks and container networking
   - Defined resource limits and container specifications

2. Next.js Application Setup
   - Initialized Next.js 14 with App Router
   - Implemented authentication system with NextAuth
   - Set up theme provider for light/dark mode support
   - Created base layout and navigation components

3. Database Integration
   - Configured Prisma ORM
   - Created initial database schema
   - Implemented migrations for solution management
   - Set up database seeding functionality

4. Solution Management Features
   - Created solution card components
   - Implemented solution creation form
   - Added solution import functionality
   - Set up solution metadata handling

### Technical Decisions
1. Chose PostgreSQL for robust relational data management
2. Implemented Docker for consistent development environment
3. Used Prisma for type-safe database operations
4. Integrated NextAuth for secure authentication

### Next Steps
1. Implement solution search and filtering
2. Add user management features
3. Enhance solution import validation
4. Implement solution deployment system

### Notes
- Docker configuration optimized for both development and production
- Database schema designed for future scalability
- Authentication system ready for custom provider integration
