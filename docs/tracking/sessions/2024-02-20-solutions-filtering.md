## Overview
Enhanced the solution filtering system with a modern sidebar interface and improved tag filtering functionality.

## Changes Made

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Implemented a modern filter sidebar that slides in from the right
2. Moved search field to the main view for better accessibility
3. Added a filter count indicator to show active filters
4. Added smooth transitions and animations for better user experience

### Filtering Logic
1. Implemented AND logic between selected tags
   - Updated API route to use Prisma's AND operator
   - Each selected tag must be present in the solution
2. Improved tag management
   - Added tag search functionality in the sidebar
   - Maintained stable tag list from initial solutions
   - Added clear visual feedback for selected tags

### Code Organization
1. Created separate types file for better code organization
2. Added proper TypeScript support throughout components
3. Improved API filtering logic with better error handling
4. Removed duplicate search field from filter sidebar

### Files Modified
- `app/src/components/features/solutions/SolutionsGrid.tsx`
- `app/src/components/features/solutions/FilterSidebar.tsx`
- `app/src/components/features/solutions/types.ts`

## Testing
