# Session: Fix Solution Creation in Admin Interface

## Overview
Fixed a 500 error that occurred when creating solutions in the admin interface. The issue was caused by a mismatch between the data format being sent (FormData) and the format expected by the API route (JSON).

## Changes Made

### Modified `/app/src/app/api/admin/solutions/route.ts`
- Updated the POST endpoint to handle FormData instead of JSON
- Added proper type conversion for different field types:
  - Numeric fields (tokenCost, rating)
  - JSON fields (tags, metadata)
  - Boolean fields (isPublished)
- Added default values as specified in the solution schema
- Added logging for better debugging
- Maintained compatibility with existing functionality

## Testing
- Successfully tested solution creation through the admin interface
- Image generation working correctly
- Form submission now completes without errors

## Technical Details
- The API route now properly parses FormData and converts fields to their expected types before validation
- Default values are set according to the schema requirements
- Maintained existing validation using the solution schema

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases or issues with the updated form handling
- Consider adding more detailed error logging if needed
