# Session: Implementing Infinite Scroll with Cursor-based Pagination

## Overview
Implemented infinite scroll functionality for the solutions page using cursor-based pagination while maintaining full search and filtering capabilities.

## Technical Changes

### API Changes
- Modified `/api/solutions` route to support cursor-based pagination
- Updated API response type to include `nextCursor` and `hasMore` flags
- Maintained compatibility with existing search and filter parameters
- Optimized query performance by using cursor-based pagination instead of offset-based

### Frontend Changes
- Enhanced `SolutionsGrid` component with infinite scroll capabilities
- Implemented Intersection Observer for scroll detection
- Added cursor state management
- Optimized solution list updates by appending new items
- Added loading indicator for subsequent page loads
- Preserved all existing search and filter functionality

### Architecture Impact
- Improved scalability by implementing cursor-based pagination
- Reduced server load by fetching only necessary data
- Enhanced user experience with smooth infinite scrolling
- Maintained existing search and filter capabilities without degradation

## Testing Notes
- Verified infinite scroll functionality
- Confirmed search and filters work with pagination
- Tested loading states and error handling
- Validated cursor-based navigation

## Performance Considerations
- Cursor-based pagination provides better performance for large datasets
- Optimized frontend rendering by appending solutions instead of replacing
- Implemented proper cleanup for Intersection Observer
- Maintained responsive UI during data fetching

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance metrics
- Gather user feedback
- Consider implementing prefetching for smoother experience
