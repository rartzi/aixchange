# Session: Fix Image Generation and Add Placeholder Pages

## Context
1. The image generation for solution cards was failing due to permission issues with the external-images directory
2. Navigation links were causing 404 errors due to missing pages

## Changes Made

### Image Generation Fixes
1. Created external-images API route to serve generated images
2. Fixed paths in both generate-image and external-images routes
3. Created necessary directories with proper permissions
4. Removed read-only flag from volume mounts
5. Updated both Dockerfiles to ensure proper directory permissions

### Placeholder Pages
Created a reusable PlaceholderPage component and implemented placeholder pages for:
1. /experiment - AI experimentation platform
2. /events - Upcoming AI events and workshops
3. /blog - AI development insights
4. /docs - Platform documentation
5. /support - Help center
6. /about - Company information
7. /contact - Contact form
8. /privacy - Privacy policy

### Docker Configuration
1. Made project name configurable in deploy.sh
2. Added proper container health checks
3. Fixed volume mount permissions

## Files Changed
1. app/src/app/api/generate-image/route.ts
2. app/src/app/api/external-images/[...path]/route.ts
3. app/Dockerfile
4. app/Dockerfile.prod
5. app/docker-compose.yml
6. app/docker-compose.prod.yml
7. app/deploy/deploy.sh
8. app/src/components/layout/PlaceholderPage.tsx
9. Added new placeholder pages under app/src/app/

## Future Considerations
1. Implement proper content for placeholder pages
2. Set up proper image backup/cleanup strategy
3. Consider implementing rate limiting for image generation
4. Add proper error handling and retry logic for image generation
