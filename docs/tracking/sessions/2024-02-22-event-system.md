# Event System Implementation Session

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive event system that allows users to participate in AI challenges, hackathons, and competitions. The system integrates with the existing solution infrastructure while maintaining separation of concerns.

## Key Components Implemented

### Pages
- `/events` - Main events listing page with filtering and search
- `/events/[id]` - Individual event page with details and solutions
- `/events/create` - Event creation page (reusing AdminEventDialog)

### Components
1. Event Display
   - `EventCard.tsx` - Card component for event previews
   - `EventsGrid.tsx` - Grid layout for event listings
   - `EventsHeader.tsx` - Page header with title and actions
   - `EventsFilters.tsx` - Search and filtering controls

2. Event Interaction
   - `JoinEventButton.tsx` - Button for event participation
   - `EventSolutions.tsx` - Solutions list for specific events
   - `EventRules.tsx` - Event rules and prizes display

### API Endpoints
1. Event Management
   - `GET /api/events` - List events with filtering
   - `POST /api/events` - Create new event
   - `POST /api/events/[id]/join` - Join an event

2. Event Solutions
   - `GET /api/events/[id]/solutions` - List solutions for an event
   - `POST /api/events/[id]/solutions` - Submit solution to an event

### Schemas
1. Event Schema
   ```typescript
   eventSchema = z.object({
     title: z.string(),
     description: z.string(),
     shortDescription: z.string(),
     startDate: z.date(),
     endDate: z.date(),
     type: z.enum(["HACKATHON", "CHALLENGE", "COMPETITION", "WORKSHOP"]),
     rules: z.string(),
     maxParticipants: z.number().optional(),
     // ... other fields
   })
   ```

2. Event Solution Schema
   - Extends base solution schema
   - Maintains compatibility with existing solution system
   - Handles event relationship through API layer

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Solution Integration
- Used raw SQL queries for event-solution relationships to avoid modifying base solution schema
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing solution features
- Extended solution submission flow to handle event context

### 2. Component Reuse
- Reused AdminEventDialog for event creation
- Adapted existing solution components for event-specific use
- Maintained consistent UI patterns across the application

### 3. Data Model
- Added Event and EventParticipant models to Prisma schema
- Created relationships between events and solutions
- Implemented audit logging for event actions

## Testing Considerations
- Event creation and management
- Solution submission within events
- Event participation flow
- Event listing and filtering
- Solution display and interaction within events

## Security Measures
- Authentication required for event participation
- Authorization checks for event creation
- Validation of event dates and participant limits
- Protection against unauthorized solution submissions

## Future Improvements
1. Event Features
   - Event categories and tags
   - Event series and recurring events
   - Event templates for quick creation

2. Participation Features
   - Team formation for events
   - Participant roles (mentor, judge)
   - Event-specific leaderboards

3. Solution Management
   - Event-specific solution requirements
   - Solution review process
   - Solution promotion to global marketplace

## Migration Notes
No migrations were required for existing solutions as the event system was implemented as an extension rather than a modification of the existing system.

## Commit Message
```
feat(events): implement event system

- Add event pages and components
- Create event API endpoints
- Implement event-solution integration
- Add event participation system
- Create event documentation

This change adds a complete event system that allows users to:
- Browse and participate in events
- Create and manage events
- Submit solutions to events
- View event-specific solutions

The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing solution
system while adding new event-specific functionality.
