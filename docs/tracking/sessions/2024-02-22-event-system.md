# Event System Implementation Session

## Overview
Added event management capabilities to AIXchange, allowing for hackathons, challenges, and other innovation events. The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing solution marketplace while adding new event-specific features.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Added Event model with fields for:
  - Basic info (title, description, dates)
  - Event status (DRAFT, UPCOMING, ACTIVE, VOTING, COMPLETED, ARCHIVED)
  - Event type (HACKATHON, CHALLENGE, COMPETITION, WORKSHOP)
  - Participation tracking
  - Solution submissions
- Added EventParticipant model for managing event registrations
- Extended Solution model to support event context
- Added proper indexes and relationships

### 2. Service Layer
- Created eventService for handling event operations
- Implemented CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Added transaction support for data consistency
- Included participant and solution counting

### 3. Admin Interface
- Added event management page under admin section
- Implemented event listing with:
  - Status filtering
  - Type filtering
  - Search capability
  - Modern card-based layout
- Added create/edit/view actions
- Included participant and submission counts

## Design Decisions

### 1. Solution Integration
- Solutions can be associated with events
- Maintained existing solution lifecycle
- Added capability for promoting event solutions to marketplace
- Preserved all existing solution functionality

### 2. Event Lifecycle
- DRAFT: Initial creation and setup
- UPCOMING: Published but not yet started
- ACTIVE: Currently running
- VOTING: Submission period ended, voting in progress
- COMPLETED: Event finished
- ARCHIVED: Historical record

### 3. User Roles
- Admin: Full event management
- Participants: Can join events and submit solutions
- Regular users: Can view public events

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Changes
```prisma
model Event {
  id              String       @id @default(cuid())
  title           String
  description     String
  shortDescription String
  startDate       DateTime
  endDate         DateTime
  status          EventStatus  @default(UPCOMING)
  type            EventType    @default(HACKATHON)
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. Service Layer Pattern
```typescript
export const eventService = {
  getAllEvents(): Promise<EventWithCounts[]>
  getEventById(id: string): Promise<EventWithCounts | null>
  createEvent(data: EventCreateInput): Promise<EventWithCounts>
  updateEvent(id: string, data: EventUpdateInput): Promise<EventWithCounts>
  deleteEvent(id: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### 3. Component Structure
- EventList: Main listing component
- EventCard: Individual event display
- StatusBadge: Visual status indicator
- Filters: Status and type filtering

## Next Steps

1. Event Creation Flow
   - Create form component
   - Add validation
   - Handle image uploads

2. Event Participation
   - Registration flow
   - Participant management
   - Solution submission process

3. Voting System
   - Implement voting mechanisms
   - Add vote tracking
   - Create results display

4. Analytics
   - Track participation metrics
   - Monitor engagement
   - Generate reports

## Migration Strategy

1. Schema Updates
   - Added new tables without modifying existing ones
   - Used nullable foreign keys for backward compatibility
   - Added proper indexes for performance

2. Data Handling
   - No initial data migration needed
   - Clean separation between marketplace and event solutions
   - Preserved existing solution queries

3. Deployment Plan
   - Database migration
   - Service deployment
   - UI updates
   - Feature flag for gradual rollout
