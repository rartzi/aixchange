## 🎯 Session Goals
1. Implement DALL-E Image Generation [P1]
   - Expected Outcome: Automatic image generation for solutions without uploaded images
   - Success Criteria: 
     * Successfully generates relevant images from solution descriptions
     * Properly saves images to external-images/solutions/
     * Falls back to placeholder image when needed
   - Dependencies: OpenAI API access, Next.js API routes

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Created

  * Dependencies: None

### Files to be Modified
- `app/src/components/features/solutions/CreateSolutionForm.tsx`: Add image generation [P1]
  * Purpose: Integrate DALL-E image generation in solution submission
  * Impact: Improves solution card visuals
  * Dependencies: New API route

### API Changes
- New endpoint `/api/generate-image` [P1]
  * Purpose: Handle DALL-E image generation
  * Method: POST
  * Input: Solution description
  * Output: Generated image path or error

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
