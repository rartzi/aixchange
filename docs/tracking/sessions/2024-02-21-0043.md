# Session: Fix Solution Image Display

## Date
2024-02-21 00:43 AM EST

## Changes Made

### Fixed Image URL Format
- Modified the image URL format in generate-image route to include '/api' prefix
- Changed from `/external-images/solutions/${filename}` to `/api/external-images/solutions/${filename}`
- This ensures images are properly served through the Next.js API route handler

## Technical Details

### Image Serving Flow
1. DALL-E generates the image and saves it to external-images/solutions directory
2. The image URL is now correctly formatted to be served through the API route
3. The external-images API route handler serves the image with proper caching and content type headers

## Testing Notes
- Verified that newly generated solution images are now displaying correctly
- Confirmed that the image URL format matches the API route pattern
