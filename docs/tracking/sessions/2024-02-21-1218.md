# Session: Fix Preserve-Seed Deployment Function

## Context
The preserve-seed deployment option was not working correctly because:
1. The preserve function was exiting before seeding could run
2. Container health checks weren't being performed after seeding

## Changes Made
Rewrote the preserve_seed function to:
1. Handle the entire deployment process itself rather than relying on preserve
2. Run database seeding with proper error handling
3. Wait for container health status after seeding
4. Provide better logging and status updates

## Testing
The function now:
1. Preserves existing volumes
2. Deploys containers
3. Waits for database readiness
4. Runs database seeding
5. Verifies container health
6. Reports detailed status

## Future Considerations
- Add option to specify which seed data to use
- Add dry-run option to preview seeding changes
- Add rollback capability if seeding fails
- Consider adding progress indicators for long-running operations
