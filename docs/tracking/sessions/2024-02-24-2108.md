# Session: Fix Admin Events Page and Related Issues

## Overview
Fixed multiple issues across the admin events page and related functionality:
1. Restored missing functionality in the admin events page
2. Fixed image handling in event forms and bulk import
3. Fixed community stats reporting

## Changes Made

### Events Admin Page
- Restored complete table functionality with sorting and filtering
- Re-implemented bulk actions (status updates, delete)
- Added back individual event actions (edit, delete)
- Maintained bulk import section
- Added bulk-delete API endpoint

### AdminEventDialog
- Fixed form fields and TypeScript errors
- Improved state management with proper default values
- Enhanced image handling:
  - Removed default image when creating new events
  - Only show image preview when an image is actually selected or generated
  - Fixed image path handling for generated images

### Image Handling System
- Added new `/api/external-images/[...path]` route to serve external images
- Updated image URL handling in bulk import:
  - Transform relative paths to use the API endpoint
  - Handle absolute URLs correctly
  - Support simple filenames
  - Generate new images when none are provided
- Fixed image path resolution for bulk imported events

### Community Stats
- Fixed incorrect stats reporting on /aixcelerate page
- Updated stats API to properly count:
  - Total active users
  - Total active solutions
  - Total public non-archived events

## Components Modified
- `app/src/app/admin/events/page.tsx`
- `app/src/components/admin/AdminEventDialog.tsx`
- `app/src/app/api/admin/events/bulk-delete/route.ts` (new)
- `app/src/app/api/external-images/[...path]/route.ts` (new)
- `app/src/app/api/admin/events/import/route.ts`
- `app/src/app/api/community/stats/route.ts`

## Testing
The following functionality has been restored and verified:
- Event listing and filtering
- Individual event editing
- Bulk operations (including delete)
- Image upload/generation
- Form validation
- Status messages
- Community stats reporting
- Image serving for bulk imported events

## Impact
- Administrators can now fully manage events with all functionality restored
- Event images are handled correctly in both admin and user interfaces
- Bulk imported events display images correctly
- Community stats now accurately reflect the platform's activity

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases or issues
- Consider adding automated tests to prevent future regressions
- Consider adding image validation to ensure proper paths are always used
- Consider adding image optimization for better performance
