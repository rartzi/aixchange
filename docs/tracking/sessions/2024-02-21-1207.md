# Session: Fix Container Name Resolution in Deploy Script

## Context
The deploy script was failing to find containers because it was using incorrect container names. Docker Compose adds a numeric suffix (-1) to container names and uses the project name as a prefix.

## Changes Made
1. Updated container name resolution in deploy.sh to use correct format:
   - From: `aixplore-portal-app`
   - To: `${PROJECT_NAME}-app-1`
2. Updated both greenfield and preserve deployment functions

## Testing
The change should allow the deploy script to properly:
1. Find the running containers
2. Check their health status
3. Display logs when needed

## Future Considerations
- Consider making container name format more configurable
- Add validation for container name resolution
- Consider adding container name logging for debugging
