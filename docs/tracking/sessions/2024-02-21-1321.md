# Session: Docker Build Fix for TailwindCSS

## Context
The production Docker build was failing due to missing TailwindCSS dependency during the build process. The error occurred because TailwindCSS was in devDependencies and the npm ci command was using the --only=production flag.

## Changes Made
- Modified Dockerfile.prod to remove the --only=production flag from npm ci command
- This ensures all dependencies (including build-time dependencies) are available during the build process
- The multi-stage build approach still maintains a lean production image

## Technical Details
- Issue: Next.js build failed with error "Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'"
- Root cause: Build-time dependencies were not being installed due to --only=production flag
- Solution: Allow installation of all dependencies during build stage while maintaining multi-stage build benefits

## Testing
The change should be tested by running:
```bash
./deploy.sh preserve-seed --prod -p 3004
