# Session Log: Image Path Configuration Fix

## Date
2024-02-24 22:08

## Type
Bug Fix

## Description
Fixed image loading issues in solution submission and event creation by aligning the external images path configuration.

### Issue
Images were failing to load with fallback to placeholder image due to path mismatch:
- Upload API was saving to `/app/public/external-images` or `external-images` (from EXTERNAL_IMAGES_PATH env var)
- External-images API was looking in `deploy/external-images`

### Root Cause
Path inconsistency between upload and serving endpoints:
1. Upload route using EXTERNAL_IMAGES_PATH env variable
2. External-images API had hardcoded path to deploy/external-images
3. Environment variable set to external-images

### Solution
Updated external-images API route to use EXTERNAL_IMAGES_PATH environment variable, ensuring consistency between upload and serving paths.

### Files Modified
- app/src/app/api/external-images/[...path]/route.ts

## Impact
- Fixed image loading in solution submission
- Fixed image loading in event creation forms
- Maintains working bulk import image functionality

## Next Steps
1. Monitor image loading functionality
2. Consider adding path validation and error logging
3. Add documentation about image path configuration
