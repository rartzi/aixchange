# Session: Solutions Page Implementation Progress

## Completed Work
1. Fixed database connection for local development
   - Updated DATABASE_URL to use localhost instead of Docker service name
   - Preserved Docker configuration in comments for reference

2. Fixed error handling in routes
   - Solutions API route
   - Stats API route
   - External images route

3. Implemented working solutions page with:
   - Full search and filtering capability
   - Stats bar showing totals and community info
   - Grid layout with responsive design
   - Loading states with skeleton cards
   - Filter sidebar with tag management

## Current State
- Solutions page is functional with basic features
- Database queries working correctly
- All API endpoints responding properly
- UI components properly integrated

## Next Steps: Infinite Scroll Implementation
1. API Changes Needed:
   - Add cursor-based pagination
   - Maintain filtering/search across full dataset
   - Return cursor for next batch

2. UI Changes Needed:
   - Add intersection observer for scroll detection
   - Implement cursor tracking
   - Append new results to existing list
   - Show loading state for next batch

3. Technical Approach:
   - Use cursor-based pagination (createdAt timestamp)
   - Keep current filtering/search logic
   - Add load more functionality
   - Preserve existing UI during loading

## Notes
- Current implementation fetches all solutions at once
- Need to balance between full dataset search and performance
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling if dataset grows large
