## Changes Made
- Modified `app/docker-compose.prod.yml` to comment out the backup service
- This change removes automated database backups from the production deployment

## Technical Details
- Commented out the entire backup service configuration in docker-compose.prod.yml
- The backup service was previously running a daily pg_dump and maintaining a 7-day backup rotation
- Database data is still persisted through the postgres_data volume

## Impact
- Reduces resource usage in production
- Removes automated backup functionality
- Manual backups will need to be handled through alternative means if required
