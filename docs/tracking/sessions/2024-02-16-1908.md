## Type
refactor(auth)

## Overview
Temporarily removing authentication requirements to accelerate testing and UI development. This change will allow faster iteration on the UI/GUI components without the need for authentication.

## Changes Made
- Modified middleware.ts to bypass authentication checks
- Updated architecture documentation to reflect temporary authentication bypass
- Note: This is a temporary change to facilitate development and testing

## Security Considerations
- This change removes authentication requirements
- Only intended for development/testing environment
- Must be reverted before production deployment
- Added documentation to ensure proper security restoration

## Testing Notes
- All routes now accessible without authentication
- Admin and moderator routes still maintain role-based redirects for UI consistency
- Verify all protected routes are now accessible

## Follow-up Tasks
- [ ] Monitor development velocity improvements
- [ ] Create checklist for re-enabling authentication
- [ ] Set timeline for security restoration
- [ ] Document all affected endpoints
