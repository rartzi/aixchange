# Session: Fix Database Seeding in Production

## Context
The database seeding was failing in production because:
1. bcryptjs package was missing in production container
2. This package is required for hashing admin password during seeding

## Changes Made
1. Updated Dockerfile.prod to:
   - Install bcryptjs globally in production container
   - Keep it available for seeding operations
   - Maintain minimal production dependencies

## Testing
The changes ensure:
1. Database seeding can run in production
2. Admin user can be created with hashed password
3. Sample solutions can be seeded

## Future Considerations
- Consider moving seeding dependencies to devDependencies
- Add option to skip password hashing in production
- Add more robust error handling for seeding
- Consider using environment variables for seed data
