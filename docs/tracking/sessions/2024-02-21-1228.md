# Session: Update Stats API and Landing Page

## Context
The stats API was not showing community members count and needed restructuring to better organize solution and community statistics.

## Changes Made
1. Updated stats API route to:
   - Include community member count (non-admin users)
   - Restructure response format for better organization
   - Separate solutions and community stats

2. Updated landing page to:
   - Use new stats API response format
   - Display correct community member count
   - Display total solution count

## Testing
The changes will:
1. Show accurate community member count (excluding admins)
2. Display total number of solutions
3. Maintain proper TypeScript type safety

## Future Considerations
- Add more detailed statistics (active/pending solutions)
- Add trend data (growth over time)
- Consider caching stats for better performance
- Add more community metrics (active users, contributions)
