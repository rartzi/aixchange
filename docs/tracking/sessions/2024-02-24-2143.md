## Date
2024-02-24 21:43

## Type
Bug Report

## Priority
High

## Description
Critical image display functionality issues have been identified in multiple areas of the application:

1. `/solution submit solution` - Images are no longer visible
2. `/admin/event create event` - Images are no longer visible
3. `/admin/event Bulk Import` - Images are working correctly (reference for comparison)

## Technical Details
- The issue appears to be inconsistent across different parts of the application
- Bulk Import functionality retains working image display, which can serve as a reference for debugging
- Multiple components affected:
  * Solution submission form
  * Event creation form

## Next Steps
1. Investigate image handling in Bulk Import to understand working implementation
2. Compare image handling between working and non-working components
3. Check for recent changes that might have affected image display functionality
4. Prioritize fix in next development session
