# Session: Add Preserve with Seeding Option to Deploy Script

## Context
We needed a way to deploy the application while preserving the database but also running the seeding script to populate it with sample data for demonstration purposes.

## Changes Made
1. Added new `preserve-seed` command to deploy.sh that:
   - Preserves existing database
   - Runs database seeding after deployment
2. Updated usage documentation to include new command
3. Added new function `preserve_seed()` to handle the combined operation

## Files Changed
- app/deploy/deploy.sh

## Usage
```bash
./deploy.sh preserve-seed --prod -p 3000
```

This will:
1. Deploy the application while preserving the database
2. Run the seeding script to populate with sample data
3. Use production configuration
4. Run on port 3000

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding more seeding options (minimal, full, demo data)
- Add ability to specify which seed files to run
- Consider adding a way to preview what data will be seeded
