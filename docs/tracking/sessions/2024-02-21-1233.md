# Session: Improve Container Health Checks and Startup

## Context
The application container was being marked as unhealthy because:
1. Health checks were starting too early
2. Not enough retries were configured
3. Database connection wasn't being properly verified during startup

## Changes Made
1. Updated start.sh script:
   - Added database connection check with retries
   - Added proper error handling
   - Maximum 30 retries with 2-second intervals
   - Clear status messages during startup

2. Updated docker-compose health check:
   - Increased start period to 120s
   - Increased retries to 5
   - Maintained 30s interval and 10s timeout

## Testing
The changes ensure:
1. Container waits for database to be ready
2. Health checks don't fail prematurely
3. Clear feedback during startup process
4. More resilient startup sequence

## Future Considerations
- Add more comprehensive health checks
- Consider adding readiness probe separate from liveness probe
- Add metrics collection during health checks
- Consider implementing circuit breaker for database connections
