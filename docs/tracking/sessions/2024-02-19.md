## Session 4 (14:28) - Solutions API Implementation & Testing Strategy

### Progress Made
1. Implemented basic CRUD operations for solutions
2. Added proper error handling
   - Validation errors with details
   - Database errors with codes
   - Generic error handling
3. Added input validation
   - Schema validation for solution data
   - Query parameter validation
4. Added proper response types
   - Consistent API response structure
   - Error response structure
   - Pagination support
5. Added documentation
   - JSDoc comments
   - Type definitions
   - Error codes

### Testing Strategy for MVP
Following an MVP-first approach, we'll implement tests in phases:

#### Phase 1 (Current) - Critical Path Tests
- [x] Basic solution creation
- [x] Basic solution retrieval
- [x] Input validation for required fields
- [x] Basic error handling

#### Phase 2 - Extended Validation
- [ ] Test all required field validations
- [ ] Test field format validations (URLs, enums)
- [ ] Test metadata validation
- [ ] Test query parameter validation

#### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
- [ ] Test pagination
- [ ] Test sorting options
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test filtering options

#### Phase 4 - Edge Cases
- [ ] Test large datasets
- [ ] Test concurrent operations
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Test error recovery

### Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 tests
2. Document test coverage requirements for each phase
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
4. Implement monitoring for test coverage

### Technical Debt
- Need to improve test mocking strategy
- Consider implementing test factories
- Add performance testing
- Add integration tests

### Commit Details
- Added solutions API implementation
- Added basic test suite
- Added proper error handling
- Added input validation
- Added response types
- Added documentation

## Daily Summary
A productive day focused on improving the project's infrastructure and API implementation:
1. Investigated and resolved schema synchronization issues
2. Updated documentation and enhanced landing page
3. Implemented database integration with metadata fields
4. Set up Solutions API with comprehensive testing strategy

Next day's focus areas:
1. Complete Phase 1 testing for Solutions API
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Implement test factories
4. Begin work on Phase 2 validation tests
