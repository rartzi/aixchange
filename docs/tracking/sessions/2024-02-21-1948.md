## Overview
Implemented user management functionality for admin users, allowing them to view and manage user roles in the system.

## Changes Made
1. Created new admin API endpoints:
   - GET /api/admin/users - List all users with their details
   - PATCH /api/admin/users - Update user roles

2. Added new admin pages and components:
   - /admin/users page with user listing and role management
   - Enhanced AdminNav component to include users section

3. Implemented features:
   - View all users with their details (email, name, role, etc.)
   - Change user roles (Admin, Moderator, User)
   - View user statistics (solutions count, reviews count)
   - Track user status and last login

## Technical Details
- Used shadcn/ui components for consistent UI (Table, Select)
- Implemented role-based access control
- Added audit logging for role changes
- Prevented admins from changing their own role

## Testing Notes
- Tested role changes with different user types
- Verified audit logging functionality
- Confirmed proper access control

## Next Steps
- Add user search and filtering
- Implement user status management (activate/deactivate)
- Add more detailed user analytics
- Consider adding bulk user operations
