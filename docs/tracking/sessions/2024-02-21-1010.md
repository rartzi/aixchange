# Session: Remove Backup Container

## Context
The backup container in the docker-compose configuration was causing unnecessary complexity in the deployment process. While database backups are important, we can implement a simpler backup strategy in the future when needed.

## Decision
Remove the backup container from both development and production docker-compose configurations to simplify the deployment process. This will:
- Reduce resource usage
- Simplify container orchestration
- Remove potential points of failure
- Make the deployment process more straightforward

## Changes Made
1. Removed backup service from docker-compose.yml
2. Removed backup service from docker-compose.prod.yml
3. Updated Dockerfile and Dockerfile.prod to properly execute start.sh with shell

## Future Considerations
- Implement a separate backup strategy using cron jobs or a dedicated backup service
- Consider using cloud-native backup solutions when deploying to production
- Document backup and restore procedures in deployment documentation
