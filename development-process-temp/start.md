# (AI)Xplore: (AI)Xchange PRD & Technical Build Plan

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Elevator Pitch
**"(AI)Xplore is ODS's engine for rapid AI innovation, uniting a dynamic (AI)Xchange, a hands-on (AI)Xperiment, and a thriving community ((AI)Xclelerate). By championing '1000 Tiny Innovations,' (AI)Xplore turns everyday ideas into breakthrough solutions—fueled by modern design, multi-dimensional ratings, and real-time analytics."**

### 1.2. Purpose of This Document
- Outline **product requirements** for (AI)Xchange—the AI solutions marketplace within (AI)Xplore.
- Provide a **technical build plan** covering architecture, deployment, security, and testing.
- Ensure **visual inspiration** (blue/purple gradients, card-based layouts) is reflected in the final design.
- Incorporate **features inspired by Hugging Face Spaces** (solution creation, frameworks, CPU/GPU selection).
- Present a **deployment strategy** that separates the (AI)Xplore platform from individual solution launches, with robust Docker and `.env` handling.

## 3. Technical Build Plan

### 3.1. Architecture & Components
- **Microservices**: Front end, back end (API), database, and optional specialized services (e.g., analytics, caching).
- **API/Data-Driven**: RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for solution management, rating submissions, analytics queries, and event handling.
- **Data Layer**:  
  - **PostgreSQL** for core entities (solutions, events, user profiles, ratings).  
  - **Elasticsearch or MongoDB** for usage logs, analytics indexing, and fast retrieval.

### 3.2. Separation of (AI)Xplore App vs. Solution Launches
1. **(AI)Xplore App Deployment**  
   - **Front End** container (React/Vue).  
   - **Back End / API** container (Python/Node.js).  
   - **Database** container (PostgreSQL), or an external DB instance.  
   - Possibly other containers (Elasticsearch, Redis, etc.) as needed.
2. **Solution (Card) Launches**  
   - Each AI solution (e.g., Streamlit app, Gradio interface) runs **in a separate container** or a separate environment (Kubernetes, Docker Compose).
   - The **"Launch"** button in (AI)Xchange triggers container spin-up or uses a managed environment (Coolify, etc.).

### 3.3. Local Docker Deployment
- **docker-compose.yml** orchestrates multiple services:
  ```yaml
  version: '3'
  services:
    (ai)xplore-frontend:
      build: ./frontend
      ports:
        - "3000:3000"
      env_file:
        - .env
      depends_on:
        - (ai)xplore-backend

    (ai)xplore-backend:
      build: ./backend
      ports:
        - "4000:4000"
      env_file:
        - .env
      depends_on:
        - (ai)xplore-db

    (ai)xplore-db:
      image: postgres:14
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER}
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
        POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME}
      volumes:
        - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  volumes:
    db-data:
  ```
- **Cleanup**: `docker-compose down -v` removes containers and volumes.
- **Secrets & Config**:  
  - `.env` holds credentials, host/port configurations.  
  - Exclude `.env` from source control; provide `.env.example`.

### 3.4. Testing Harness
- **Unit Tests**: Validate business logic for rating, solution creation, event management.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure correct interactions between front end, back end, and database.
- **E2E Tests**: Simulate user flows (create solution, rate solution, join hackathon, view analytics).
- **Continuous Integration**: Each commit triggers automated tests, ensuring no regressions.

### 3.5. Monitoring & Logging
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitor container performance, CPU usage, memory, and network.
- **ELK Stack**: Aggregate logs from each container for advanced search and analytics (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### 3.6. Deployment Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Planning & Design (Weeks 1-3)**  
   - Finalize UI mockups with **blue/purple gradients**, card-based layout, rating modals, and analytics dashboard.  
   - Define data schemas for solutions, ratings, events, and usage logs.
2. **Phase 2: Core Development (Weeks 4-12)**  
   - **Sprint 1 (Weeks 4-6)**:  
     - Set up repo, CI/CD, testing harness, basic (AI)Xchange backend (solution CRUD, rating endpoints).  
     - Initial front end listing solutions and showing average ratings.  
   - **Sprint 2 (Weeks 7-9)**:  
     - Implement multi-category rating modal (stars, thumbs up/down), analytics board, hackathon/event flows.  
     - Integrate (AI)Xperiment "Publish" to (AI)Xchange.  
   - **Sprint 3 (Weeks 10-12)**:  
     - Expand admin dashboards (time-based growth, usage trends, rating analytics).  
     - Finalize Docker Compose scripts, `.env` management, local deployment docs.  
     - E2E testing and performance optimization.
3. **Phase 3: Testing, Security & Launch (Weeks 13-16)**  
   - Full QA cycle: unit, integration, E2E tests.  
   - Security audits, RBAC checks, compliance verifications.  
   - Documentation (user guides, rating guidelines, analytics usage instructions).  
   - Soft launch for internal teams; gather feedback and finalize improvements.  
   - Full-scale release.

## 4. Operational Considerations

1. **Scalability**  
   - Architect for horizontal scaling (Kubernetes or Docker Swarm).  
   - Cache rating and analytics queries if needed.
2. **Secrets Management**  
   - For production, use Docker secrets or a vault service.  
   - Keep `.env` usage to local/staging environments.
3. **Continuous Improvement**  
   - Regular sprints to refine rating categories, expand analytics, add new solution frameworks.  
   - Integrate user feedback from hackathons, (AI)Xperiment prototypes, and community events.
